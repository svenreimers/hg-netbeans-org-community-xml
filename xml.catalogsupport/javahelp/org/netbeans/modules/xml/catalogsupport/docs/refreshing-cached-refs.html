<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>If you realize that a referenced file outside your project has changed, you may need to refresh that reference.</p>
<p><b>To refresh a cached XML file reference:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>In the Projects window, select the project node of the project where you reference the XML file.</li>
<li>Right-click the node and choose Properties.<br>
The Project Properties dialog box opens.</li>
<li>In the Categories list, select the <tt>XML&nbsp;Catalog</tt> node.<br>
The right panel of the dialog box now contains a list of XML catalog entries.<br>
Each entry describes an XML reference, with its reference key, the location URI as it appears in the referencing XML document, and referenced location, which is a pointer that could be resolved to an actual location.<br>
Some entries have an absolute URI that is mapped to a local cache directory, shown in the Cache Location field.</li>
<li>Click Clear Cache.<br>
The IDE removes the cached referenced file. The next time your project tries to access the referenced file, the IDE will retrieve a new version.</li>
<li>Click OK to close the Project Properties dialog box.</li>
</ol>
