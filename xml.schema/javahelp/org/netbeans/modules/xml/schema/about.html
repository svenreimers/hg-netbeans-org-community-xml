<title>About XML Schema Tools</title>

<body>
<h2><a name="about"></a>About XML Schema Tools</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The XML schema tools available in this release of NetBeans Enterprise Pack provide tools for editing, visualizing, and refactoring XML Schema, WSDL, and BPEL documents. The XML schema tools focus on complex information display and real-world use issues (for example, scalable visualization and editing of massive XML schemas). In addition, the XML Schema Editor reduces the complexity of creating and editing XML schemas, thus allowing someone who is not a schema expert to create and modify XML schema and other XML documents. Using XML schema tools, you can reference external schemas and run advanced queries to analyze your schemas.</p>

<h3>Tasks</h3>
<p>Using the XML Schema Editor, you can:</p>

<h3>Views in the Source Editor</h3>
<p>When you open an XML schema file in the IDE, the Source Editor opens that file in a tab that contains several views. The Source Editor tab for the schema file has three buttons that you use to access the different views: Source, Schema, and Design.  </p>
