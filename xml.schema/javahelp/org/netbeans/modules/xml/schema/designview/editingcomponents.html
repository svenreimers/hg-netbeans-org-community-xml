<p>You can use the Design view to change schema component properties, and rename and delete schema components. If you delete or rename a component, the IDE automatically performs the necessary refactoring actions in the background to ensure the validity of your schema file.</p>

<ol>
<li>From the IDE main menu, choose Window &gt; Properties.</li>
<li>In the schema design area of the Design view, select the <tt><i>component</i></tt> node.</li>
<li>Make your changes in the Properties window.</li>
</ol>
