<title>Adding a Reference Component to an XML Schema File</title>

<h2>Adding a Reference Component to an XML Schema File</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>You use reference to create a reference to a named <tt><i>component</i></tt> in your schema and any schema files referenced in your schema.</p>
<p><b>To add a reference:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>In the IDE, open the schema file where you want to add the reference.</li>
<li>In the Schema view, right-click the node of the schema component where you want to add the reference and choose Add&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<i>component</i>&nbsp;Reference from the pop-up menu.<br>
<i>component</i> can be one of the following:<br>
<ul>
<li>Attribute</li>
<li>Attribute Group</li>
<li>Element</li>
<li>Group</li>
</ul>
The <i>component</i> Reference dialog box opens.</li>
<li>Use the nodes in the selection box to navigate to and select the component you want to reference.</li>
<li>Click OK.<br>
The IDE adds a reference node to the Schema view. The icon for the reference node matches the icon of the component you referenced, with an arrow (<img src="../images/badgearowref.png" alt="Arrow icon, badge">) on top of the component icon.<br>
For example, an element reference has the following icon: <img src="../images/badgearowref_element.png" alt="Element reference icon">.</li>
</ol>
