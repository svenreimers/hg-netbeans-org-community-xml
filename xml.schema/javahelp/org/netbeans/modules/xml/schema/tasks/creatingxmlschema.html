<h2>Creating XML Schema Files</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>After you create an XML schema file, you use the Schema view and the Design view of the XML schema editor to add schema components to the file.</p>

<p><b>To create an XML schema file:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>In the IDE, open the project in which you want to add the XML schema file.</li>
<li>In the Projects window, select the project node of your project, right-click and choose New&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;File/Folder.</li>
<li>In the New File dialog box, under Categories, select the <tt>XML</tt> node.</li>
<li>In the File Types list, select <tt>XML&nbsp;Schema</tt> and click Next.</li>
<li>In the Name and Location page of the wizard, in the File Name field, type a name for the file.</li>
<li>(Optional) To change the default folder for the file, use the Browse button next to the Folder field to navigate to and select another folder for the file.<br>
By default, the new <tt>.xsd</tt> file will be created in the <tt>src</tt> folder and appear under the <tt>Source&nbsp;Packages</tt> node&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<tt>&lt;default&nbsp;package&gt;</tt> node in the Projects window.</li>
<li>(Optional) Change the Target Namespace for the XML schema file.</li>
<li>Click Finish.<br>
The Projects window now contains a node for the <tt>.xsd</tt> file you just created.<br>
The newly created subnode is selected and the Source Editor contains a tab for the new XML schema file.<br>
The Schema view is the active view in the Source Editor.</li>
</ol>
