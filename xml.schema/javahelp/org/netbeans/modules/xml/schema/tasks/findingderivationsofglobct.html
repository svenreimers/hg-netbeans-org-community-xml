<h2>Finding Derivations of a Global Complex Type in an XML Schema</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>Using the query functionality in XML schema tools, you can quickly find derivations of a global complex type in a schema.</p>

<p><b>To find derivations of a global complex type:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>In the Projects window, select and right-click the <tt>.xsd</tt> file node.</li>
<li>Choose Query&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Find Derivations of Complex Type from the pop-up menu.<br>
The Find Derivations dialog box opens. This dialog box shows all the complex types defined in the schema.</li>
<li>In the list, select the complex type for which you want to find derivations and click OK.<br>
The XML Schema Query window opens with the results of your query. You can right-click a schema component node in the graph pane to navigate directly to that component definition in the Source view of the XML schema editor.</li>
