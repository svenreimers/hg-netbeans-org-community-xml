<h2>Validating XML Schema Files</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>You can use the XML validation functions that are part of the IDE to make sure your XML schema is well-formed and valid.</p>
<p><b>To verify that an XML schema file is well-formed:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Open the XML schema file.<br>
The Schema view of the XML schema editor should open with the selected file. If your XML schema file is not well-formed, the IDE does not show the content of the schema file, instead, a message appears in the center of the view to let you know that there is a problem and that you need to use the Source view to fix the errors.</li>
<li>Switch to the Source view of the XML schema editor and click the Check XML button <img src="../images/check_xml.png" alt="Check XML">&nbsp;in the editor toolbar.<br>
The IDE checks the XML and if there are errors, the Output window provides you with more information.</li>
</ol>
