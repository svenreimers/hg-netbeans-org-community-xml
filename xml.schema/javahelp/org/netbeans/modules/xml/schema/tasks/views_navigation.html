<h2>XML Schema Editor: Navigating Between Views</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>This topic provides a summary of the ways you can navigate between the XML schema views. Before you use the instructions in this topic to navigate between the XML schema views, open a schema file in the IDE. By default, the IDE opens the Schema view for the schema file.</p>
<ul>
<li>From the Source view:
<ul>
<li>Position the cursor in a component definition, right-click and choose Go&nbsp;To&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Schema to navigate directly to the Schema view with that component definition selected in the view.</li>
<li>Position the cursor in a global complex type or global element component definition, right-click and choose Go&nbsp;To&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Design to navigate directly to the Design view with that component definition selected in the view.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>From the Schema view:
<ul>
<li>Select any component node, right-click and choose Go&nbsp;To&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Source to navigate directly to the Source view with the cursor at the beginning of the component's block. </li>
<li>Select a global complex type or global element node, right-click and choose Go&nbsp;To&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Design to navigate directly to the Design view with the selected component highlighted.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>From the Design view:
<ul>
<li>Select any component node, right-click and choose Go&nbsp;To&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Source to navigate directly to the Source view with the cursor at the beginning of the component's block. </li>
<li>Select any component node, right-click and choose Go&nbsp;To&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Schema to navigate directly to the Schema view with that component definition selected in the view.</li>
</ul></li>
