<h2><a name="xmlrefactoring"></a>XML Refactoring Window (XML Schema Tools)</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>When you initiate a refactoring action from the Schema view or the Design view of the XML schema editor, the XML Refactoring window lets you preview the changes before executing the refactoring action. The window has three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Toolbar.</b> The toolbar buttons let you refresh information in the window, expand and collapse nodes in the tree pane, and cycle through the found usages.</li>
<li><b>Tree pane.</b> The tree pane contains nodes representing usages of a schema component.</li>
<li><b>Graph pane.</b> The graph pane shows a graphical representation of the information in the tree pane.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Productivity Tips</h3>
<p>Use the information below to zoom, pan, and drag the graph pane of the XML Refactoring window.</p>
<ul>
<li>To zoom out: right-click in the graphic and drag up.</li>
<li>To zoom in: right-click in the graphic and drag down.</li>
<li>To pan: click and drag in any direction.</li>
<li>To drag a node: click and drag the node.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you drag a node out of the display area, you can bring it back using one of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pan in the direction of the node until it is visible in the display area again.</li>
<li>Zoom out until the node is visible in the display area.</li>
<li>Click the Layout button <img src="../images/relayout_var3.png" alt="Layout button">&nbsp;in the toolbar of the Graph pane of the XML Refactoring window.</li>
<li>Repeat the refactoring action.</li>
</ul>
