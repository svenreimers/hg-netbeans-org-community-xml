<h2>Generate Binding and Service Port Dialog Box</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

<p>You use the Generate Binding and Service Port dialog box to create a binding and service from an existing port type.</p>

<p>A <i>binding</i> contains protocol and data format information for the operations and messages of a port type. 
A <i>service</i> consists of one or more related ports. 
A <i>port</i> associates a binding with a network address, thus defining an individual endpoint that clients can access.</p>

<ul>

  <li><b>Binding Name.</b> Enter a name for the binding.</li>

  <li><b>Binding Type.</b> Select the type of binding.</li>

  <li><b>Binding Subtype.</b> The choices vary depending on the binding type. 
    Many of the binding types have a single choice for the binding subtype. 
    For information about the binding types that have multiple choices for the binding subtype, see 
    <a href="../binding_subtype_FTP.html" title="WSDL Binding Types: FTP">WSDL Binding Types: FTP</a>,

  <li><b>Service Name.</b> Enter a name for the service.</li>

  <li><b>Port Name.</b> Enter a name for the port.</li>
