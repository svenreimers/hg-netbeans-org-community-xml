<h2>Finding Usages of WSDL Components</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

    The XML Usages window opens in the lower part of the IDE. The window has three parts:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Toolbar.</b> The toolbar buttons let you refresh information in the window, expand and collapse nodes in the 
      tree pane, and cycle through the found usages.</li>
    <li><b>Tree pane.</b> The tree pane contains nodes for the results of the query.</li>
    <li><b>Graph pane.</b> The graph pane shows a graphical representation of the results.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>To zoom out, right-click in the graphic and drag up. To zoom in, right-click in the graphic and drag down.</li>
  <li>To pan, click and drag in any direction.</li>
