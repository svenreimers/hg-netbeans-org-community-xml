<h2>WSDL Binding Types: HTTP</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

<p>When creating or editing a WSDL file, you may be prompted to select a binding type and a binding subtype. 
A <i>binding</i> contains protocol and data format information for the operations and messages of a port type.</p>

<p>If you select the HTTP binding type, then you must select one of the following binding subtypes:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>GET with urlEncoded encoding.</b> 
  The binding uses the GET verb, and message parts are encoded into the HTTP request URI using the standard URI-encoding rules.</li>
<li><b>GET with urlReplacement encoding.</b> 
  The binding uses the GET verb, and message parts are encoded into the HTTP request URI using a replacement algorithm.</li>
<li><b>POST with urlEncoded encoding.</b> 
  The binding uses the POST verb, and message parts are encoded into the HTTP request URI using the standard URI-encoding rules.</li>
<li><b>POST with urlReplacement encoding.</b> 
  The binding uses the POST verb, and message parts are encoded into the HTTP request URI using a replacement algorithm.</li>
</ul>
