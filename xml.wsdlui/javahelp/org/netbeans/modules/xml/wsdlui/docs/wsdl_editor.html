<h2>About Editing WSDL Files</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

<p>The WSDL Editor enables you to edit Web Services Description Language (WSDL) files.</p>

<p>WSDL is an XML-based language for describing web services. 
A WSDL file contains the following types of information:</p>

<ul>
<li>Information about the functionality of the web service</li>
<li>Information about how to access the web service</li>
</ul>

<p>The WSDL Editor supports version 1.1 of the WSDL specification.</p>

<!--
<p>In a BPEL Module project, you use WSDL files to define the interfaces for business processes and their partner services.</p>
-->

<p>The WSDL Editor provides the following views:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the <a href="wsdl_editor_source.html">Source view</a>, the underlying XML source code appears.</li>
<li>In the <a href="wsdl_editor_views.html">WSDL view</a>, the WSDL file appears as a tree component or a series of columns.</li>
<li>In the <a href="wsdl_editor_partner.html">Partner view</a>, you can visualize and configure the abstract elements in a WSDL file.</li>
</ul>

<p>To create a WSDL file, you use a wizard. You must choose one of the following approaches:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a WSDL file <a href="wsdl_editor_creating.html">from scratch</a></li>
<li>Create a WSDL file based on an <a href="wsdl_editor_creating_existing.html">existing WSDL file</a></li>
</ul>
