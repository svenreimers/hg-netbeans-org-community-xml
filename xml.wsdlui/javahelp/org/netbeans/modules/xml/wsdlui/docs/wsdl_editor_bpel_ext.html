<h2>Configuring Partner Link Types Using the WSDL View</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

<!--
<p>Before you can add a partner link to a BPEL process, 
you must add a partner link type to the WSDL file.</p>

<p>In a BPEL process, a <i>partner link</i> represents the interaction between the BPEL process and a partner service. 
  Each partner link is associated with a partner link type.</p>

<p>A <i>partner link type</i> characterizes the conversational relationship between two services. 
  The partner link type can have one or two roles. 
  A role describes the function that a service has in the relationship. 
  Examples of roles are <tt>loanRequestor</tt> and <tt>loanProcessor</tt>. 
  Each role must specify the port type that the service will use to receive messages.</p>
-->

<p>A <i>partner link type</i> characterizes the conversational relationship between two services. 
A partner link type can have one role or two roles.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If a partner link type has one role, then the relationship involves a service that is willing to interact with any other service, without placing any requirements on the other service.</li>
  <li>If a partner link type has two roles, then the relationship involves two peer services.</li>
</ul>

<p>A role describes the function that a partner has in the relationship. 
For example, in a procurement scenario, the partner link type could have two roles: <tt>Buyer</tt> and <tt>Seller</tt>.</p>

<p>A role must specify the port type that the service will use to receive messages.</p>

<p><b>To add a partner link type automatically</b></p>

<ol>
  <li>When you do either of the following tasks, a partner link type is automatically generated. 
    The partner link type has a default role.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Create a WSDL file from scratch.</li>
    <li>Create a port type.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>(Optional) To add a second role, do the following:</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Right-click the partner link type node and choose Add &gt; role.</li>
    <li>If the Properties window is not visible, choose Window &gt; Properties.</li>
    <li>Select the role.</li>
    <li>(Optional) Change the default name.</li>
    <li>Specify the port type.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<p><b>To add a partner link type manually:</b></p>

<ol>
  <li>In the WSDL view, right-click the Extensibility Elements node and choose Add &gt; PartnerLinkType. <br>
    A partner link type node appears under the Extensibility Elements node. 
    The partner link type has a default role.</li>
  <li>(Optional) To add a second role, right-click the partner link type node and choose Add &gt; role.</li>
  <li>If the Properties window is not visible, choose Window &gt; Properties.</li>
  <li>For each role, do the following:</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Select the role.</li>
    <li>(Optional) Change the default name.</li>
    <li>Specify the port type.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
