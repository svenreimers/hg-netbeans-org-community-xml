<h2>Using Code Completion in WSDL Files</h2>

<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

<p>The WSDL Editor enables you to use the following types of code completion in WSDL files:</p>

<ul>

  <li><b>Element code completion.</b> When you type a starting tag (&lt;) inside a parent element, 
         the code completion box displays a list of child elements for the parent element. 
         For example, assume that you place the cursor immediately after the <tt>&lt;portType&gt;</tt> element. 
         When you type the starting tag (&lt;), the code completion box displays the following list of child elements: 
         <tt>documentation</tt> and <tt>operation</tt>.</p>

  <li><b>Attribute code completion.</b> When you press Spacebar inside an element tag, 
         the code completion box displays a list of attributes for the element.</li>

</ul>

<p>The code completion box can include elements and attributes that are specific to individual bindings, 
such as the FTP binding.</p>

<p>When the code completion box is visible, you can continue typing to fine tune the selection of items in the list. 
You can also use the mouse or navigation keys to scroll through the list.</p>

<p>To select an item in the list, do one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Highlight the item and press Enter</li>
  <li>Double-click the item</li>
</ul>
