<h2>Creating a WSDL File Based On an Existing WSDL File</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

<p>Instead of creating a WSDL file from scratch, you can create a WSDL file based on an existing WSDL file.</p>

<p><b>To create a WSDL file based on an existing WSDL file:</b></p>

<ol>
  <li>In the Projects window, right-click the project and choose New &gt; Other.</li>
  <li>In the Choose File Type wizard page, do the following:</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>In the Categories list, select the <tt>XML</tt> node.</li>
    <li>In the File Types list, select the <tt>External WSDL Document(s)</tt> node.</li>
    <li>Click Next.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>In the Specify Resource Location wizard page, do one of the following:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>To create a WSDL file based on a running service:</li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Select the From URL button.</li>
      <li>Enter the URL of the service's WSDL file.</li>
      <li>Click Finish.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>To create a WSDL file by using an existing WSDL file on the local file system:</li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Select the From Local File System button.</li>
      <li>Specify the folder where the WSDL file is located.</li>
      <li>Click Finish.</li>
    </ol>
  </ul>
  The WSDL file is created. The WSDL Editor appears in WSDL view.
  </li></ol>
