<h2>Using Find in the WSDL View</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

<p>You can search for WSDL components in the current WSDL file.</p>

<p>You can define the type of find to be performed:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Search Selection.</b> 
         Starts the find action from the component most recently selected in the WSDL view.</li>
  <li><b>Use regular expression.</b> 
         The phrase entered into the text field is treated as a regular expression, with case-sensitivity.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information about regular expressions, see 
<a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.usersguide/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/editing/find_regexp.html" title="Regular Expressions For Finding and Replacing Text">Regular Expressions For Finding and Replacing Text</a>.</p>

<p><b>To search for WSDL components:</b></p>

<ol>
  <li>From from the IDE's main menu, choose Edit &gt; Find. You can also press Ctrl-F.<br>
      The Find bar opens at the bottom of the WSDL view.</li>
  <li>In the Find box, click the magnifying glass icon and select the type of search that you want to perform: 
      Component Name, Component Kind, Attribute Declaration, or Attribute Value.</li>
  <li>If you want to find matches from a specific point, then select a component in the WSDL view, click the magnifying glass icon, and select Search Selection.</li>
  <li>If you want to use a regular expression, then click the magnifying glass icon and select Use regular expression.</li>
  <li>In the Find box, type the text or regular expression and press Enter.<br>
      The IDE finds any matching components and highlights the matches in the WSDL view.</li>
  <li>To cycle through the matching components, use the Find Next and Find Previous buttons.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>To clear highlights after a search:</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>In the Find bar, click Clear.<br>
      The highlights are removed from the WSDL view.</li>
</ul>
