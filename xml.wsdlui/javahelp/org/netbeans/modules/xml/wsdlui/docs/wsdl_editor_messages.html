<h2>Configuring Messages Using the WSDL View</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

<p>You can use the WSDL Editor to create, edit, and delete messages.</p>

<p>In a WSDL file, a port type contains one or more related operations that the web service can perform. 
  An operation receives a message, sends a message, or does both.</p>

<p>Each message contains one or more logical parts. 
  For each part, you must specify the name and the type of content.</p>

<p>If you change the name of a message or part, 
  then the WSDL Editor renames all occurrences in the same file. 
  To rename all occurrences in associated XSD, WSDL, and BPEL files as well, 
  right-click the component node and choose Refactor &gt; Rename.</p>



<p><b>To create a message:</b></p>

<ol>
  <li>In the WSDL view, right-click the Messages node and choose Add Message. <br>
    A message node appears. The message contains one part. The part's type of content is undefined.</li>
  <li>If the Properties window is not visible, choose Window &gt; Properties.</li>
  <li>The Element or Type property specifies the type of content. 
    To set the value, click the ellipsis (...) button. 
    The Element or Type dialog box enables you to select any of the built-in types in W3C XML Schema. 
    If you added an inline schema or imported a schema, then you can select an element or type from the schema.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>To add a part to a message:</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>Right-click the message node and choose Add &gt; Part. <br>
    A part node appears. The type of content is undefined.</li>
</ul>



<p><b>To change the name of a message or part:</b></p>

<ol>
  <li>If the Properties window is not visible, choose Window &gt; Properties.</li>
  <li>Select the message or part node.</li>
  <li>Set the Name property to the new name.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>To delete a message or part:</b></p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the message or part node.</li>
  <li>Press Delete.</li>
</ol>
