<h2>Creating Messages Using the Partner View</h2>

<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

<p>The Messages area in the Partner view contains one configuration box for each message in the WSDL file.</p>

<p>In a WSDL file, a port type contains one or more related operations that the web service can perform. 
  An operation receives a message, sends a message, or does both.</p>

<p>Each message contains one or more logical parts. 
  For each part, you must specify the name and the type of content.</p>



<p><b>To create a message:</b></p>

<ol>

  <li>Do one of the following:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Click Add Message.</li>
    <li>Drag the Message icon from the Palette onto a blank portion of the Messages area.</li>
    <li>Right-click a blank portion of the Messages area and choose Add Message.</li>
  </ul>
  The configuration box for the message appears. The message contains one part. The part's type of content is undefined.</li>

  <li>Do one of the following:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>In the Part Element or Type column, click the ellipsis (...) button. 
        Select any of the built-in types in W3C XML Schema. 
        If you added an inline schema or imported a schema, then you can select an element or type from the schema. 
        Click OK.</li>
    <li>Drag an element or type from the Navigator window onto the Part Element or Type column.</li>
  </ul>

</ol>

        A new row appears. The type of content is set to <tt>xs:string</tt>.</li>
    <li>Right-click the configuration box for the message and choose Add Part from the pop-up menu.<br>
        A new row appears. The type of content is undefined.</li>
    <li>Drag an element or type from the Navigator window onto the configuration box for the message, 
        and above or below an existing row.<br>
        A new row appears. The type of content is set to the element or type that you selected.</li>
