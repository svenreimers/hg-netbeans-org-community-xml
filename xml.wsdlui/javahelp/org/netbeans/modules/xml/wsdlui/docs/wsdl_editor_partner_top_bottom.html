<h2>Strategies for Defining the Abstract Elements</h2>

<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

<p>In the Partner view of the WSDL Editor, 
you can define the abstract elements by starting with the partner interactions 
or by starting with the messages that are exchanged by the partners.</p>

<p><b>To define the abstract elements by starting with the partner interactions:</b></p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a partner link type. 
    The partner link type contains a default role, which appears on the right. 
    If you want to define a peer-to-peer interaction, then you must add a second role on the left.</li>
  <li>Choose or create the port types and operations.</li>
  <li>Create the messages that will be sent from one partner to another.</li>
  <li>Assign the messages to the partner link type's operations.</li>
  <li>Specify the data types for the message parts. 
    Note that you can create or import an XML schema by using the Navigator window, 
    and then drag the schema elements or types into the messages.</li>
</ol>
